## About this Website

This website is designed both as a way to share what I've done in computer science over the years, as well as a blog of smaller things I've done so others can learn how to do them too. I have a backlog of older projects I've created that I since forgot how they were made, so this is also a place for me to publicly document how my code works.

## About Me
I'm a (hopeful) future software/cybersecurity dev who's been dipping his toes into practically every aspect of computing, like microprogramming, sodering, AI development, and more, but I've spent most of my time on cybersecurity and finishing CTF challenges. I go to school at JMU and live in an area close to Richmond, Virginia. I've been fascinated with computers since I used my Wii back in 2010, and have since been trying to create something similar to the experience I've had then.

For personal hobbies, I'm a fan of racing sports like F-1 and Martial Arts like Taekwondo, but because I sadly cannot afford an [Aston Martin ARAMCO 2025 Sim](https://us.f1authentics.com/products/aston-martin-aramco-f1-team-amr25-simulator?variant=55857602527613&sim_variant=55857602527613), I'll just stick to Taekwondo. I'm also a fan of reading historical books, video games (Nintendo and Capcom, FGC games, F1 25), and improving my flexibility.
