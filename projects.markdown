## Projects

This contains my projects I've done for my classes in high school and college! This page is still a work in progress.

### CS343 Detective Board

This web project involved me making a click-and-drag board to make an old school pin detective board to see what users came across. It was an overly ambitious project for a first time web application, and the end result didn't achieve all the goals I had with it, but it was very helpful for learning javascript and CSS styling. The application can utilize localstorage to save your data and restore it, and has a now deprecated way to save your data to google drive that is no longer functional. You can access [the detective board here](/343Project/).
