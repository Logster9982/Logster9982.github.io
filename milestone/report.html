            <li>No repository was created for this milestone</li>
            <li>Site is on the jmu stu server and avaliable on https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/altomolx/cs343/milestone/</li>
            <li>This is report.html!</li>
            <li>I was unable to complete this section. I used the lab06 as a template to use the css parameters, but I was unable to optimise the small screens</li>
            <li>There are 5 working pages so far, index (main), Documentation, examples, and the two external links</li>
            <li>There is a header, it has the title and the buttons for creation on it</li>
            <li>There is a sidebar with navigation links</li>
            <li>There are images in the notes, they have alt attributes</li>
            <li>The nu test shows no errors, WAVE shows no critical (level A) errors</li>
            <li>Headers use sans-serif and paragraphs use arial</li>
            <li>The add form has a version of the modal form from lab07, it can't do anything aside from display.</li>
            <li>Site has two external links</li>
            <li>The first network request would be to jsdelivr.net for css styling, and this is actually already in the code, just with little usage. The 2nd idea qwould be for microsoft onedrive request so I can store the data over there, rather than stu.</li>
